# array-introduction

This should really cover why arrays are valuable. It can be pretty hard to articulate why they are important, but I like the example of if I give you apples one by one, how many can you hold? 2 easily, and maybe with some awkwardness like 5? That is just a bunch of variables. But! If I give you a basket to put them in, you can carry so many more. Grab from the beginning of https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/array-readme
